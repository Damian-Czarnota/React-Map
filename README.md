This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Project
## It is the finally project of Udacity Google Scholarship.

This app is a map created in React framework.
To display details about places I used Foursquare API.
App uses [google-maps-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-maps-react) to handle displaying maps and its components (eg. markers).

## The points of app:
App displays five hardcoded places in my neighbourhood.
Markers can be filtered via left navbar.
Each marker has an extra information about place to which it is attached (function ```onClick``` shows infoWindows, it works on list and markers).

# Technology I used:
- React
- CSS
- HTML
- Foursquare API
- Google Maps API
